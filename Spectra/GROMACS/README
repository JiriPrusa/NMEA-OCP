# scripts to prepare and run nma on gromacs produced trajectories
# copy templ.top to ITP folder and writePWgro.tcl to proper place
# copy nma_min.mdp and nma.mdp to MDP folder
# copy run_nma_metacentrum.sh to folder within PATH
# run prepare_nma.sh - copy template topology, reference frame
                     - center protein within MD trajectory
                     - extract frames with waters around, align them to reference, prepare topology (processTraj.tcl)
# run execute_nma_min.sh - copy starting structure, topology and parameters to individual directories
                         - run minimization and hessian calculation
# run execute_diag.sh - check if Hessian file exists
                      - run Hessian diagonalization
# check if finished, harvest solution (check_diag.sh, harvest_diag.sh)
# Calculate the isotropic and/or anisotropic spectra by python scripts
# calcSpectra.py
